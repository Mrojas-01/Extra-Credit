After finding out what GitHub is and how it works, I realized how useful GitHub can really be. As a student I realized how much easier it would be to go over for homework and to hep others and vise versa. Usually I would be working with my friend Sabrina on my programming sending programs back forth to each other constantly deleting and adding things to each other’s programs. Most of the time while doing that causes us to forget what was on that line so if it was wrong, we would have to go back through emails and retest them to see what was written beforehand. 
With the knowledge of GitHub, it would’ve saved me the hassle of having to scroll through a bunch of emails because with its features of  being able to see what was changed and added to the program would make it so much easier to help each other on programs. Making it visually noticeable of all the changes made to the program but still having an original copy of the program which could’ve saved me so much time on trying to figure out what was my starting program.
